            <h2>Challenges women face due to gender discrimination</h2>

            <p>Here is a list of challenges women face due to discrimination because of their gender:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list-heading">Gender Violence</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Gender-based violence includes physical, emotional, and psychological harm targeted at individuals because of their gender, leaving survivors with lasting trauma and fear.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-heading">Sexual Harassment</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Sexual harassment in workplaces, schools, and public spaces undermines dignity and safety, silencing victims and limiting their opportunities.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-heading">Employement discrimination</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Women often face unequal pay, fewer promotions, and limited career growth, despite having the same skills and qualifications as men.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-heading">Leadership representation crisis</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Gender bias and systemic barriers prevent women from holding leadership positions, resulting in underrepresentation in decision-making roles.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-heading">Threats to reproductive rights</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Restrictions on reproductive healthcare and choices deny women autonomy over their own bodies and futures.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are just a few of the issues women face due to them just being women</p>

            <h2>Challenges with getting gender equality normalized</h2>

            <p>A list of why it is difficult to implement gender equlity smoothly: </p>

            <ul>
                <li class="list-heading">Lack of women in leadership</li>
                <li>
                    <p>With just 27 per cent of parliamentary seats and 28 per cent of management positions held by women, there is a lack of diverse perspectivesin decision-making processes, hindering comprehensive policy formulation</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-heading">Poverty and lack of economic opportunities</li>
                <li>
                    <p>More than 340 million women and girls are projected to live in extreme poverty by 2030. This represents a staggering 8 per cent of the global female population surviving on less than USD 2.15 a day. Social protections, access to decent work, and other support systems are urgently needed to provide a path out of poverty.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-heading">Workplace discrimination and inequlaities</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Only 61 per cent of prime working-age women participate in the labour force, compared to 91 per cent of prime working-age men. This affects both economic growth and societal progress. In 2019, for each dollar men earned in labour income, women earned only 51 cents.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-heading">An imbalance in unpaid care work</li>
                <li>
                    <p>On the current trajectory, the gap between the time spent by women and men on unpaid care will narrow slightly, but by 2050, women globally will still be spending 9.5 per cent more time (2.3 more hours per day) on unpaid care work than men. This persistent gap limits women's participation in education, employment, and other opportunities.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-heading">Socital norms and cultural practices</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation persist. Globally, one in five young women is married before age 18. The prevalence of child marriage highlights the need for attitudinal shifts and the promotion of legal frameworks that safeguard women and girls' rights.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-heading">Inadequate access to education and health care</li>
                <li>
                    <p>An estimated 110 million girls and young women may remain out of school by 2030. Stalled progress in reducing maternal mortality and expanding educational opportunities call for targeted interventions to meet the 2030 goals.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-heading">Gender based violence</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Each year, 245 million women and girls experience physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner. Older women also face higher rates of poverty and violence than older men.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-heading">Legal barriers and poorly enforced legislation</li>
                <li>
                    <p>At least 28 countries do not have laws granting women equal rights to enter marriage and initiate divorce, and 67 countries lack laws prohibiting direct and indirect discrimination against women. Where legislation does exist to promote gender equality, effective implementation remains a challenge.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
